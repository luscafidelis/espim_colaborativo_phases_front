ESPIM combines selected procedures from programmed teachingtechnologies, Experience Sampling Method (ESM) techniques and ubiquitous computing to plan, create and implement intervention programs. The method was modeled based on the usage of theories associated to ESM and programmed instruction to define better planning of intervention programs and ubiquitous computing techniques, such as contextual information and mobile devices to fully or partially implement the programmed intervention. The definition and evolution of the method was iteratively built, partnering with researchers, creating versions of the software solution that allows its application. Case studies in the areas of health and education were conducted to evaluate the method."
